Completed: All Parts are completed and fully implemented

Incomplete: N/A

Test Cases Used:
 - For each object I tested first tested the case sensitivity requirement. To do this I used the matchesKeyword function and chose a substring in the object to check.
 - For each object I checked edge cases like empty strings and leading spaces
 - Tested test cases spoke about in piazza where for example: "Bluetooth Speaker" , matchesKeyword( Speaker) == true and matchesKeyword(  Speaker) == false (two leading whitespaces)
 - Checked that virtual methods are successfully called through their base pointers
