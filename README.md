# UCLA CS 32 Projects (Fall 2025)

This repository contains my implementations of  C++ projects for UCLA's CS 32 course, demonstrating  skills in **object-oriented programming, data structures, dynamic memory management, and C++ design**.

## Projects Overview

### **Project 1: Blood Donation & Vacation Credit Management System**
- **Summary:** HR system to track employee blood donations and automatically credit vacation hours.  
- **Key Skills:** C++ classes, **dynamic memory with raw pointers**, Rule of Three, modular design, date validation, deterministic return codes.  
- **Highlights:** Accurate business logic enforcement, edge-case handling (leap years, exact spacing), using tests validating functionality.  

---

### **Project 2: TaskList with Doubly Linked List**
- **Summary:** Custom doubly linked list implementation for a to-do list ADT.  
- **Key Skills:** **Pointers and dynamic memory**, Rule of Three (deep copy, assignment, destructor), linked list operations (add, remove, find, get), memory-safe design.  
- **Highlights:** Full coverage of edge cases, robust memory management, no STL containers used, clean modular design.

### **Project 3: SmartCatalog – AI Product Categorizer**
- **Summary:** Polymorphic catalog system for e-commerce products (Clothing, Books, Electronics).  
- **Key Skills:** **Abstract base classes, pure virtual functions, polymorphism, virtual destructors, heap memory management**.  
- **Highlights:** Base-class pointers for derived objects, deterministic output for autograder, keyword-based search with case-insensitive matching.

### **Project 4: MiniHub Collections Tool** (To be implemented)
- **Summary:** Fast collections management tool using **hash tables, binary search trees, and stable sorting algorithms**.  
- **Key Skills:** Separate-chaining **hash tables**, BST insertion/deletion (leaf, one child, two children), **stable insertion & merge sort**, memory-safe C++ design, integration of multiple data structures.  
- **Highlights:** Efficient lookups and ordered traversal, stable sorting, combined data structures for consistency, automated test runner verifying functionality.
